Solwearth SE Series - Distinctive Technical Features
Processing Technology: Solwearth employs a proprietary multi-stage indirect heat and 
dry decomposition process, distinguishing it from conventional high-temperature aerobic composting. 
This technology processes waste without requiring additives, wood chips, chemicals, or charcoal, 
and consumes zero fresh water.​

Water Recycling System: The machines feature integrated water recycling technology that captures 
condensate runoff and uses it to control humidity in the processing chamber, 
resulting in faster processing speeds compared to standard OWC systems.​

Processing Speed Advantage: Solwearth models complete cycles in 12-30 hours depending on capacity, 
with the SE-501 achieving completion in just 12-16 hours—significantly faster than the 24-48 hour 
industry standard.​

Power Efficiency: Power consumption ranges from 2.8 kW (SE-501) to 12 kW (SE 1H), 
demonstrating efficient energy usage relative to capacity—the SE-501 consumes only 2.8 kW 
for 50 kg capacity compared to competitors requiring 3+ kW for similar capacity.​

Installation Requirements: Unlike conventional OWC machines requiring exhaust ventilation 
and special installation, Solwearth models need no special installation or dedicated exhaust 
ventilation systems due to integrated deodorization.​

Performance & Operational Comparisons
Volume Reduction Consistency: Solwearth achieves 83-90% volume reduction across all models, with 
weight reduction of 70-90% depending on waste composition—matching or exceeding industry standards.​

Processing Time Efficiency:

Solwearth SE-501: 12-16 hours for 50 kg (fastest in class)

TANCO OWC-50A: 24 hours for 50 kg

Greenius G-25: 24 hours for 30 kg

Solwearth SE 1H: 27-30 hours for 1000 kg (enterprise scale)​

Power-to-Capacity Ratio Analysis:

Solwearth SE-501: 56 watts per kg (2.8 kW ÷ 50 kg)

Solwearth SE-1001: 40 watts per kg (4 kW ÷ 100 kg)

Solwearth SE-2001: 30 watts per kg (6 kW ÷ 200 kg)

TANCO OWC-100A: 60 watts per kg (6 kW ÷ 100 kg)

TANCO OWC-200A: 45 watts per kg (9 kW ÷ 200 kg)​

Weight-to-Capacity Efficiency:

Solwearth SE-501: 6 kg machine weight per kg capacity (300 kg ÷ 50 kg)

Solwearth SE-1001: 4.2 kg per kg capacity (420 kg ÷ 100 kg)

TANCO OWC-100A: 6 kg per kg capacity (600 kg ÷ 100 kg)

Greenius G-25: 11.7 kg per kg capacity (350 kg ÷ 30 kg)​

Design & Construction Quality
Material Superiority: All Solwearth models utilize 100% stainless steel construction for the entire body, 
ensuring superior corrosion resistance compared to competitors using SS-304 only for inner chambers 
with MS powder-coated exteriors.​

Portability: Solwearth SE series features stand-alone, portable designs across all capacity ranges, 
enabling relocation flexibility for changing business requirements.​

Compact Footprint: Despite high capacities, Solwearth models maintain compact dimensions—the 
SE-501 occupies only 1.15m × 0.9m floor space for 50 kg capacity, making it ideal for 
space-constrained urban installations.​

Safety & Environmental Features
Safety Systems: All Solwearth models include automatic impeller shutdown when hopper doors open, 
preventing operational accidents—a critical safety feature matched by premium competitors.​

Integrated Odor Control: Built-in deodorization and foul odor control systems eliminate the 
need for external exhaust systems or activated carbon filters required by competing brands.​

Zero Liquid Discharge: Solwearth systems produce only sterile biomass output and minimal condensate runoff, 
with no "dirty water" discharge to sanitary systems—a significant environmental advantage 
over wet composting systems.​

Emissions Profile: The multi-stage indirect heat process prevents harmful gas emissions without 
requiring external filtration systems, unlike high-temperature aerobic composters needing bio-filters.​

Input Flexibility & Output Quality
Waste Compatibility: Solwearth machines process all organic materials and compostable disposables 
including food waste, vegetable peels, fruit scraps, cooked food, bread, rice, dairy products, 
and even compostable packaging.​

Output Characteristics: Final product is sterile biomass suitable for soil enrichment, 
meeting municipal solid waste management standards without requiring external 
curing or post-processing.​

No Additives Required: Unlike conventional composters requiring bacterial cultures, 
enzymes, sawdust, or bulking agents, Solwearth machines operate without any supplemental materials.​

Commercial Viability Analysis
Price Positioning: Solwearth SE series starts at approximately ₹4,00,000 for entry 
models with capacity ranges from 25 kg to 1000 kg per batch, offering competitive pricing 
for the feature set.​

Target Applications: Models are specifically optimized for restaurants, apartments, IT campuses, 
hospitals, institutional canteens, flight caterers, food courts, convention centers, 
and fast-food franchises.​

International Presence: Solwearth operates across 10 countries including India, Maldives, 
Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Malaysia, and Bangladesh—demonstrating 
proven international deployment.​

Warranty & Support: Standard 1-year manufacturer's warranty covering all components 
and manufacturing defects, with AMC/CAMC options available for extended support.​

Government Recognition: Empanelled by National Seeds Corporation, Government of India under 
Swachh Bharat Mission in the Decentralized Composting Machine (MISCA) category—providing credibility 
for institutional purchases.
