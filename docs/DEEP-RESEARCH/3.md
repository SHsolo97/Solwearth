Below is a structured, source-linked **fact sheet** you can use to draft the 2,500–3,000 word blog article “IGBC Waste Management Requirements: How to Earn Maximum Green Building Points” (positioned for developers/ESG/FMs, and differentiated for an OWC manufacturer like Solwearth).

## Validated keywords (SEO)
- Primary keyword: **IGBC waste management** (cluster supported by IGBC program pages + rating manuals that repeatedly use “waste management / waste collection & disposal / organic waste management”).

## Competitor analysis (top results + gaps)
Top “competitors” ranking for IGBC waste queries are mostly **IGBC manuals/PDFs** and broad green-building explainers; there is little to no manufacturer-grade guidance that translates credits into “what OWC capacity/spec/documentation do I need?”. [igbc](https://igbc.in/igbc-net-zero-waste-rating-systems/)

- Competitor 1: IGBC Green New Buildings Rating System (official PDF)  
  - URL: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC_Green_New_Buildings_Rating_System_(Version_3.0_with_Fifth_Addendum).pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC_Green_New_Buildings_Rating_System_(Version_3.0_with_Fifth_Addendum).pdf)
  - What it covers: lists “Organic Waste Management, Post-occupancy” (2 points) and “Handling of Waste Materials, During Construction” (1 point) under building-material/resource credits. [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC_Green_New_Buildings_Rating_System_(Version_3.0_with_Fifth_Addendum).pdf)
  - Gap to exploit: does not coach project teams on **how to select and size** an on-site organic waste system (e.g., translating occupancy → kg/day → OWC capacity), nor does it explain vendor-ready documentation sets in a step-by-step “submission checklist” style. [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC_Green_New_Buildings_Rating_System_(Version_3.0_with_Fifth_Addendum).pdf)

- Competitor 2: IGBC Green Existing Buildings O&M (official PDF, Version 2)  
  - URL: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Green%20Existing%20Building%20(O&M)%20-%20Version%202.pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Green%20Existing%20Building%20(O&M)%20-%20Version%202.pdf)
  - What it covers: “SF Mandatory Requirement 2: Waste Management (Required)” plus “SF Credit 1: Enhanced Waste Management (3 points)” with compliance paths including dry-waste reduction, 100% dry-waste recycling/reuse, and wet-waste composting using natural composting or an **OWC** to convert 100% wet waste into manure. [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Green%20Existing%20Building%20(O&M)%20-%20Version%202.pdf)
  - Gap to exploit: it names the OWC path but does not provide a **buyer’s guide** (equipment features, O&M staffing, odor/leachate controls, space planning, AMC/logbooks) that helps teams implement without rework. [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Green%20Existing%20Building%20(O&M)%20-%20Version%202.pdf)

- Competitor 3: IGBC Net Zero Waste rating (official landing page + manual)  
  - URL: https://igbc.in/igbc-net-zero-waste-rating-systems/, Manual PDF: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Net%20Zero%20Waste%20Rating%20System%204%20May%202022%20.pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Net%20Zero%20Waste%20Rating%20System%204%20May%202022%20.pdf)
  - What it covers: frames Net Zero Waste around adopting 3R principles and achieving “zero” landfill by balancing waste generated vs reused/recycled. [igbc](https://igbc.in/igbc-net-zero-waste-rating-systems/)
  - Gap to exploit: high-level framework; limited “what equipment qualifies” implementation guidance for on-site organic waste processing and audit-proof measurement/MRV (measurement, reporting, verification). [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Net%20Zero%20Waste%20Rating%20System%204%20May%202022%20.pdf)

**Confirmation (positioning claim):** Across the above top-ranking/authoritative results, the content is either a rating manual or a general explainer—not an OWC-manufacturer-focused guide that maps each IGBC waste credit to OWC selection, sizing, layouts, and documentation “packages.” [igbc](https://igbc.in/igbc-net-zero-waste-rating-systems/)

## Waste management credit details (by IGBC program)
### IGBC Green New Buildings (waste-related credits surfaced in manual)
- “Organic Waste Management, Post-occupancy” is listed as **2 points** in the IGBC Green New Buildings rating system (in the Building Materials/Resources section list shown in the manual excerpt). Source: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC_Green_New_Buildings_Rating_System_(Version_3.0_with_Fifth_Addendum).pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC_Green_New_Buildings_Rating_System_(Version_3.0_with_Fifth_Addendum).pdf)

- Content hook for Solwearth: this program explicitly creates a points pathway for **post-occupancy organic waste management**, which is where an on-site OWC is typically positioned (vs. only vendor haulage). [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC_Green_New_Buildings_Rating_System_(Version_3.0_with_Fifth_Addendum).pdf)

### IGBC Green Homes (Version 3 addendum excerpt: organic waste treatment thresholds)
- The Green Homes addendum excerpt describes a compliance option to “install on-site waste treatment system” for treating **at least 50%** organic waste generated, with outputs (manure/power, etc.) reused in-situ; biogas can be considered. Source: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/abridged/IGBC%20Green%20Homes%20(V3)%20Addendum%20on%20Mixed%20Used%20Residential%20Projects.pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/abridged/IGBC%20Green%20Homes%20(V3)%20Addendum%20on%20Mixed%20Used%20Residential%20Projects%20(June%202025)%20(1).pdf)
- Points mapping shown in the excerpt: **>50% = 1 point; >75% = 2 points; >95% = 3 points** (based on percentage of treated organic waste). Source: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/abridged/IGBC%20Green%20Homes%20(V3)%20Addendum%20on%20Mixed%20Used%20Residential%20Projects.pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/abridged/IGBC%20Green%20Homes%20(V3)%20Addendum%20on%20Mixed%20Used%20Residential%20Projects%20(June%202025)%20(1).pdf)
- The addendum provides default organic waste generation factors for calculations: **0.25 kg/person/day (residential)** and **0.1 kg/person/day (commercial)**, unless local byelaws are more stringent. Source: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/abridged/IGBC%20Green%20Homes%20(V3)%20Addendum%20on%20Mixed%20Used%20Residential%20Projects.pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/abridged/IGBC%20Green%20Homes%20(V3)%20Addendum%20on%20Mixed%20Used%20Residential%20Projects%20(June%202025)%20(1).pdf)

### IGBC Green Existing Buildings O&M (Version 2: mandatory + credit options)
- The checklist shows “SF Mandatory Requirement 2: Waste Management (Required)” and “SF Credit 1: Enhanced Waste Management (3 points).” Source: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Green%20Existing%20Building%20(O&M)%20-%20Version%202.pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Green%20Existing%20Building%20(O&M)%20-%20Version%202.pdf)
- Enhanced Waste Management compliance options include: dry waste reduction (e.g., 20% reduction vs preceding year), 100% dry waste recycling/reuse, and “Wet Waste Composting” where the facility uses natural composting or installs an **Organic Waste Convertor (OWC)** to convert **100% wet waste** into manure. Source: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Green%20Existing%20Building%20(O&M)%20-%20Version%202.pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Green%20Existing%20Building%20(O&M)%20-%20Version%202.pdf)
- Documentation signals in the credit text include providing certificates/letters from recyclers or contracts, plus photographs of segregation bins and a centralized waste collection yard with signage and schematic locations.

## IGBC Net Zero Waste info (requirements + how OWCs fit)
- IGBC’s official landing page positions the Net Zero Waste rating system as enabling buildings/built environments to adopt **3R (reduce, reuse, recycle)** principles. Source: https://igbc.in/igbc-net-zero-waste-rating-systems/ [igbc](https://igbc.in/igbc-net-zero-waste-rating-systems/)
- The Net Zero Waste manual defines the core outcome: a project demonstrates that total waste generated equals waste reused within premises plus waste recycled, so that net waste sent to landfill is “Zero.” Source: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Net%20Zero%20Waste%20Rating%20System%204%20May%202022%20.pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Net%20Zero%20Waste%20Rating%20System%204%20May%202022%20.pdf)
- A separate “Net Zero Waste to Landfill” manual excerpt explicitly calls for installing an on-site waste treatment system (approved by Swachh Bharat Mission Urban) to treat **100% organic waste** at building level and use output as manure on-site or at another site. Source: https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Net%20Zero%20Waste%20to%20Landfill%20Rating%20System%20Manual%20(Pilot%20Version).pdf [igbc](https://igbc.in/frontend-assets/html_pdfs/IGBC%20Net%20Zero%20Waste%20to%20Landfill%20Rating%20System%20Manual%20(Pilot%20Version)%20-%20November%202021.pdf)

## Statistics (certified buildings + adoption signals)
- IGBC published scale stats (highly cite-worthy in your intro): **18,850+ registered projects**, **15.52 billion sq.ft. footprint**, **7,370 certified & fully operational projects**. Source: https://www.igbc.in [igbc](https://www.igbc.in)
- A secondary market note (IBEF, citing Savills India) reports “over 7,000 IGBC-certified projects” and ~1,370 million sq.ft. built-up area. Source: https://www.ibef.org/news/india-has-over-7-000-igbc-certified-projects [ibef](https://www.ibef.org/news/india-has-over-7-000-igbc-certified-projects)
- Business press reports “over 14,511 green building projects… covering 12.307 billion square feet have adopted IGBC ratings” (useful as a broader adoption datapoint, though it’s not the same as “certified/operational”). Source: https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/aim-to-have-10-billion-square-feet-of-green-buildings-in-10-years-igbc-124102401.html [business-standard](https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/aim-to-have-10-billion-square-feet-of-green-buildings-in-10-years-igbc-124102401360_1.html)
- CREDAI scale + IGBC collaboration (good for “social proof + momentum” section): CREDAI “brings together more than **13,300+ members** from **230 city chapters** across **21 states**,” and under the association it pledged **4,000 projects by 2030** adopting IGBC Green & Net Zero rating systems (per press coverage).

## IGBC vs LEED vs GRIHA (waste comparison datapoints you can cite)
| System | Waste-related credit signals (from sources found) | What to say in the blog (positioning-safe) |
|---|---|---|
| IGBC | One comparison table (secondary source) lists “Waste management” weightage as **3 points (3%)** in IGBC vs **2 points (1.9%)** in LEED. Source: https://www.kewaunee.in/blog/igbc-vs-leed-certifications/  [kewaunee](https://www.kewaunee.in/blog/igbc-vs-leed-certifications/) | Use as a directional comparison only (cite it as a third-party summary), then pivot to the fact that IGBC manuals explicitly name on-site organic waste management credits (where an OWC directly supports compliance).  [kewaunee](https://www.kewaunee.in/blog/igbc-vs-leed-certifications/) |
| LEED | Same secondary table reports **2 points** for “waste management.” Source: https://www.kewaunee.in/blog/igbc-vs-leed-certifications/  [kewaunee](https://www.kewaunee.in/blog/igbc-vs-leed-certifications/) | Keep it brief unless you pull USGBC primary sources later; position LEED as having waste-related MR credits, but don’t over-specify point math without USGBC citations.  [kewaunee](https://www.kewaunee.in/blog/igbc-vs-leed-certifications/) |
| GRIHA | GRIHA’s official criteria/weightage table shows “Solid Waste Management” (4 points) and “Organic Waste Treatment On-Site” (2 points). Source: https://www.grihaindia.org/griha-rating  [grihaindia](https://www.grihaindia.org/griha-rating) | Strong India-relevant comparator: GRIHA explicitly calls out on-site organic waste treatment as a points item, similar in intent to IGBC’s organic waste pathways.  [grihaindia](https://www.grihaindia.org/griha-rating) |

## People Also Ask / related questions (SERP-adjacent, source-based)
Direct Google “People Also Ask” boxes vary by user/location and weren’t exported as a discrete dataset here, but these **closely related SERP questions** appear as FAQ-style queries in green-certification content and can be used as blog H2/H3s: [piousearth](https://piousearth.in/blog/green-building-certification/)

If you want, the next step is to convert this fact sheet into a blog-ready outline that explicitly maps: **each IGBC credit → OWC requirement → sizing formula → documentation pack → common site mistakes** (and weave in Solwearth’s “48+ CREDAI builders” social proof where it naturally strengthens trust).
