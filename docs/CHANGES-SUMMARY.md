# Changes Applied - Blog Layout & India Dropdown Fix

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. **Blog Section Layout Fix**
**Problem:** Blog pages had their own background gradients, making them look different from the rest of the site.

**Solution:** 
- Removed `bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-50 to-white` from blog listing page wrapper
- Removed `bg-gray-50` from CTA section
- Removed `bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-50 to-white` from individual blog post page
- Removed `bg-gray-50` from related posts section

**Result:** Blog pages now use the same white background as the rest of the website, maintaining visual consistency.

### 2. **India Dropdown Styling Fix**
**Problem:** India appeared as a button with an arrow in the Locations dropdown, looking visibly different from other countries.

**Solution:**

#### Desktop Navigation:
- Changed India from a hoverable submenu button to a regular link (like other countries)
- India now links to `/locations/india` overview page
- Indian cities appear as indented sub-items below India
- Used left border and indentation to show hierarchy
- Removed the right-pointing arrow
- Removed complex hover state management

**Before:**
```
Locations ▼
  India ▶ (button with submenu)
    → Bangalore
    → Mumbai
    ...
  ──────────
  Maldives
  Saudi Arabia
```

**After:**
```
Locations ▼
  India (clickable link)
    └── Bangalore
    └── Mumbai
    └── Chennai
    ... (11 cities)
  ──────────
  Maldives
  Saudi Arabia
```

#### Mobile Navigation:
- India appears as a clickable link first
- Added "Indian Cities" collapsible section for the city list
- Cities are more deeply indented for clear hierarchy
- Maintains consistency with desktop version

**Before (Mobile):**
```
Locations ▼
  India ▼ (expandable)
    India Overview
    Bangalore
    Mumbai
```

**After (Mobile):**
```
Locations ▼
  India (link to overview)
  Indian Cities ▼ (expandable)
    Bangalore
    Mumbai
    Chennai
```

## 🎨 Styling Changes

### India Dropdown (Desktop):
```tsx
// India Link (same as other countries)
<Link href="/locations/india" className="...">
  India
</Link>

// Indian Cities (indented with border)
<div className="pl-4 border-l-2 border-gray-200 ml-4 my-1">
  {indianCities.slice(1).map(city => (
    <Link className="block px-4 py-2 text-sm text-gray-600">
      {city.label}
    </Link>
  ))}
</div>
```

### Visual Hierarchy:
- **India:** Same font weight and color as other countries (text-gray-700)
- **Cities:** Slightly lighter color (text-gray-600) to show they're sub-items
- **Indentation:** Left padding + border creates clear visual hierarchy
- **No arrow:** Removes the confusing right-pointing chevron
