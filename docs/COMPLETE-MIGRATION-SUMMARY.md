## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification
```powershell
# Build and verify
pnpm run build

# Expected: ✓ Compiled successfully
# Expected: No redirect errors
```

### 2. Commit Changes
```powershell
git add next.config.mjs
git add *.md
git commit -m "Complete website migration: 72 redirects (blog, products, locations)"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Production
- Automatic deployment via Vercel (on push to main)
- Or manual deployment: `vercel --prod`

### 4. Post-Deployment Testing
```powershell
# Test sample redirects
curl -I https://www.solwearth.com/se501
curl -I https://www.solwearth.com/bangalore
curl -I https://www.solwearth.com/benefits-of-organic-waste

# All should return: 301 Moved Permanently
```

### 5. Update Google Search Console
- Submit updated sitemap
- Request reindexing of key pages
- Monitor for crawl errors

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Redirect Behavior:
1. **301 = Permanent:** Tells search engines this is a permanent move
2. **Client-side:** Redirects happen in Next.js app (not DNS/server level)
3. **Instant:** Takes effect immediately on deployment
4. **Cached:** Next.js caches redirect configuration for performance

### Bad Endpoints Handling:
The following URLs are intentionally **NOT** redirected (they'll return 404):
- `/home-demo/`
- `/new-home/`
- `/new-machine/`
- `/timeline/`
- `/index-testimonial/`
- `/request-demo/`

**Reason:** These were development/test pages never meant to be public. Letting them 404 is correct behavior.

### Special Cases:

1. **SE-2501 → SE-2001:**
   - Old site had incorrect model number (se2501)
   - Corrected to proper model (se-2001)

2. **SE-10001 → SE-1H:**
   - Old site used numeric code (se10001)
   - New site uses brand name (se-1h for 1 Ton model)

3. **India Overview:**
   - Old: `/organic-waste-converter-machines-in-india`
   - New: `/locations/india`
   - Reduces 49 chars to 16 chars (67% reduction!)
