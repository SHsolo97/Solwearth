## BLOG #68: How Food Waste Contributes to Climate Change: The Methane Problem

### Prompt A: Deep Research Agent Directive

```
You are a specialized research agent. Conduct research for "How Food Waste Contributes to Climate Change: The Methane Problem" for Solwearth Ecotech.

CONTEXT:
- Environmental awareness article — connects food waste to climate change.
- Positions on-site OWC processing as a methane prevention tool.
- The final blog article (written by a separate Writing Agent) targets 2,500 words. Scale your research depth to comprehensively support an article of this length.

RESEARCH TASKS:

1. SEARCH STRATEGY:
   - Primary keyword: "food waste climate change"
   - Long-tail LSI keywords:
     * "food waste methane emissions"
     * "food waste greenhouse gas"
     * "landfill methane food waste"
     * "composting reduces methane"

2. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS: Medium competition — environmental organizations dominate.

3. DATA EXTRACTION:
   - Food waste as % of global GHG emissions (8-10% per UN data).
   - Methane production from landfilled organic waste: mechanism and timeline.
   - Methane vs CO2: 80x more potent GHG over 20 years.
   - India-specific: methane from landfills, India's waste-related GHG contribution.
   - Paris Agreement commitments and India's NDC (methane reduction).
   - Global Methane Pledge and India's stance.
   - How on-site OWC processing prevents methane:
     * Aerobic processing → CO2 (much less potent) not CH4.
     * No landfill decomposition.
     * No transportation emissions.
   - Quantifiable methane reduction per tonne of food waste diverted from landfill.
   - Role in carbon credit markets.
   - IPCC data on waste sector emissions.
   - Corporate methane reporting requirements (BRSR, CDP).

4. USER INTENT MAPPING:
   - Primary: INFORMATIONAL — understanding the food waste-climate connection.
   - Audience: ESG professionals, sustainability leaders, policy researchers.

5. OUTPUT FORMAT: Structured Bulleted Fact Sheet with emissions data and sources.
