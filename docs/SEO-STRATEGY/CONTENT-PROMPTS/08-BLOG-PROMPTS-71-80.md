## BLOG #74: Composting in Tropical Climates: India-Specific Considerations

### Prompt A: Deep Research Agent Directive

```
You are a specialized research agent. Conduct research for "Composting in Tropical Climates: India-Specific Considerations" for Solwearth Ecotech.

CONTEXT:
- India's tropical/sub-tropical climate creates unique waste management challenges.
- High temperature + high humidity = rapid decomposition, odor, pest attraction.
- Solwearth's enclosed OWC eliminates climate concerns.
- The final blog article (written by a separate Writing Agent) targets 2,000 words. Scale your research depth to comprehensively support an article of this length.

RESEARCH TASKS:

1. SEARCH STRATEGY:
   - Primary keyword: "composting tropical climate India"
   - Long-tail LSI keywords:
     * "composting India hot weather"
     * "composting monsoon season"
     * "waste management tropical climate"
     * "Indian climate composting"

2. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS: Very low competition for this specific angle.

3. DATA EXTRACTION:
   - India climate zones and their impact on waste decomposition.
   - Tropical challenges for open composting: rapid decomposition, odor amplification, pest/fly breeding.
   - Monsoon challenges: water logging of compost pits, leachate contamination.
   - Summer heat: excessive drying or odor escalation.
   - Coastal humidity: mold growth, corrosion of equipment.
   - Why traditional composting methods (pit, windrow) struggle in India:
     * 95% of Indian cities have tropical/sub-tropical climate.
     * Open composting complaints dominate (odor, flies, rodents).
   - Advantages of enclosed OWC in tropical conditions:
     * No exposure to rain/monsoon.
     * No pest/fly attraction (enclosed, heat-processed).
     * No odor (enclosed processing).
     * Consistent processing regardless of season.
     * Stainless steel construction resists corrosion.
   - Regional considerations: Kerala (high humidity), Rajasthan (extreme heat), Mumbai (monsoon), Delhi (extreme seasons).

4. USER INTENT MAPPING:
   - Primary: INFORMATIONAL — "Will composting work in my climate?" → "Yes, with the right technology."
