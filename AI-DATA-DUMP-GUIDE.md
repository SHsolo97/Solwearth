# Load data
with open('SOLWEARTH-AI-DATA-DUMP.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Query for product by capacity
def recommend_product(daily_waste_kg):
    for product in data['products']:
        capacity_range = product['capacity'].split('-')
        min_cap = int(capacity_range[0])
        max_cap = int(capacity_range[1].split(' ')[0])
        
        if min_cap <= daily_waste_kg <= max_cap:
            return product
    return None

# Usage
recommended = recommend_product(80)
print(f"Recommended: {recommended['name']}")
print(f"Capacity: {recommended['capacity']}")
```
