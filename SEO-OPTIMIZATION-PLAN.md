## üéØ SEO Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Technical SEO Fixes (Priority: HIGH)

#### 1.1 Add Apple Touch Icons
**Issue**: Missing Apple touch icon for iOS devices
**Solution**:
```html
<!-- Add to app/layout.tsx -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create 180x180px Apple touch icon from logo
- [ ] Generate multiple favicon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 192x192, 512x512)
- [ ] Create site.webmanifest file
- [ ] Add meta tags to layout.tsx

---

#### 1.2 Fix Heading Structure
**Issue**: Duplicate headings, skipped levels, too many headings

**Current Problems**:
- Multiple H2s with same text (e.g., "Contact Details", "Why Choose Us?")
- Skipping from H2 to H4 without H3
- 26 headings for the amount of content is excessive

**Solution Strategy**:
```
Proper Hierarchy:
H1 (1 per page) - Main page title (already fixed in hero section)
‚îú‚îÄ H2 - Major sections (Products, About, Achievements, etc.)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ H3 - Subsections (Product names, Features, etc.)
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ H4 - Minor details
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ H3 - Other subsections
‚îî‚îÄ H2 - Next major section
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Audit all pages for heading hierarchy
- [ ] Ensure only ONE H1 per page (hero/main title)
- [ ] Convert duplicate H2s to H3s where appropriate
- [ ] Remove unnecessary headings (use bold text instead)
- [ ] Follow proper nesting (never skip levels)
- [ ] Reduce heading count to 10-15 per page
- [ ] Update component files:
  - [ ] `components/lead-form-section.tsx` - Multiple H2s and H3s
  - [ ] `components/about-section.tsx`
  - [ ] `components/products-section.tsx`
  - [ ] `components/achievements-section.tsx`
  - [ ] `components/certifications-section.tsx`
  - [ ] `components/locations-section.tsx`
  - [ ] `components/technology-section.tsx`

---

#### 1.3 Fix Internal Links
**Issue**: Duplicate anchor texts, missing anchor text, trivial anchor text

**Problems Identified**:
- Links with same anchor text pointing to different URLs
- Image links or buttons without descriptive text
- Generic text like "Click here", "Learn more", "Read more"

**Solution**:
```typescript
// BAD Examples:
<Link href="/products/se-1001">Learn more</Link>
<Link href="/products/se-5001">Learn more</Link>
<Link href="/contact"><img src="..." /></Link>

// GOOD Examples:
<Link href="/products/se-1001">SE 1001 Waste Converter Details</Link>
<Link href="/products/se-5001">SE 5001 Organic Waste Converter</Link>
<Link href="/contact" aria-label="Contact Solwearth for Waste Management Solutions">

</Link>
```

**Action Items**:
